### Week 2 of "An App A Week" Challenge - Daily News App!

Displays the day's biggest news in a Instagram-story esque manner for easier digestion for the user

### Technical write-up 

Unfortunately, this week was more of a cautionary tale than a technical one. After wasting 2 days, I attempted to implement a Rate-Your-Driving app that kept track of how well an user drove inside the while lines of the road. After trying several trivial implementations of detecting white lines on a road using OpenCV, the accuracies of the programs were nowhere near the level I wanted them to be. The programs would completely fail when the lines are somewhat faded, and although with more time and more tuning I think such a program would have been reasonably made, I had 2 days left of the 7 days.

So I quickly pivoted to making an news app with an Instagram-story esque look for easier readability and interactivity from users in 2 days. Although it is very rough around the edges, I think the idea of showing users the day's most critical news in a easily summarized Story format is an idea that holds merit. Additionally, I was able to practice CollectionViews and animations in the short time.
